1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.

   - **Aspect Tested**: Instruction following, explanation clarity, audience awareness
   - **Response**:

   ```
    Sure! Object-oriented programming is a way of writing computer programs that focuses on creating objects that have their own characteristics (called attributes) and behaviors (called methods).

    Think of objects as items or things in the real world, like a car or a person. Each object has properties that describe it (like color, size, or speed) and actions it can perform (like drive, stop, or accelerate).

    In object-oriented programming, we can create classes which are like blueprints for objects. These classes define what attributes and methods an object of that class will have. We can then create instances of these classes, which are actual objects that we can use in our program.

    This approach helps organize code by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable pieces which can be reused in different parts of the program. It also makes it easier to understand and maintain the code as it mirrors the way we think about things in the real world.
   ```

   - **Evaluation**: Beginner-friendly & to the point
   - **Improvement**: Streamline the explanation using simpler metaphors (e.g., car), maintain clarity, and condense slightly for readability.

2) Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points‚Ä¶

   - **Aspect Tested**: Summarization & Conciseness
   - **Input**:

   ```
    Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points:

    The US stock market has been on a wild ride this year. After tumbling into correction in March and flirting with a bear market in April, the index recouped its losses in May and June and is up more than 3.5% year-to-date.

    The S&P 500 had entered the year hitting record high after record high. The index hit its last record high on February 19 as Wall Street rallied at the start of Trump‚Äôs second term.

    The index began to tumble in March and April as the president unveiled his tariff policy, and it‚Äôs been trying to claw its way back toward a new record high since.

    After Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúLiberation Day‚Äù tariffs on April 2, the S&P 500 closed at its lowest level this year on April 8, down 18.9% from its February record high. At its low, the S&P 500 had shed \$9.8 trillion in market value since its record high, according to FactSet data.

    The S&P 500 rallied sharply in April after Trump walked back his massive ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù tariffs. The index then gained 6.15% across May as the rebound rally accelerated, posting its best monthly gain since November 2023 and its best performance in May since 1990. The benchmark index is up 3% so far in June, recovering trillions of dollars in market value since April.

   ```

   - **Response**:

   ```
   Key points:
    1. The US stock market experienced significant volatility in the past months.
    2. The S&P 500 hit record highs at the beginning of the year but tumbled in March and April due to tariff policies announced by the President.
    3. The market rallied in May and June, with the S&P 500 recouping losses and posting gains, up more than 3.5% year-to-date.
    4. After hitting a low in April, the index saw a significant rebound, gaining 6.15% in May and 3% in June.
   ```

   - **Evaluation**: Precise & works as a great summarizer
   - **Improvement**: Keep summary in bullet format but enhance structure and wording for clarity and natural flow.

3. Write a short, imaginative story (100‚Äì150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.

   - **Aspect Tested**: Creativity & story telling capability
   - **Response**:

   ```
    In the quiet corner of the abandoned workshop, Robot B-14 sat alone, gears clinking softly as it scanned the room with curious eyes. Hidden in the shadows, a small mechanical spider scuttled forth, its eight legs twitching in apprehension. "Hello, friend," Robot B-14 greeted, extending its metallic hand in camaraderie.

    At first wary, the spider soon realized that Robot B-14 meant no harm. With time, the two unlikely companions bonded over shared stories and dreams. The robot shared tales of far-off galaxies and ancient technologies, while the spider spun intricate tales of its own adventures within the workshop's forgotten nooks and crannies.

    Together, they found solace in each other's company, proving that friendship knows no boundaries ‚Äì not even between a towering robot and a tiny mechanical spider.

   ```

   - **Evaluation**: Creative, easy to consume, emotional tone but a lot of abstraction.
   - **Improvement**: Boost creativity using higher temperature, vivid imagery, and a more emotional narrative arc.

4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?

   - **Aspect Tested**: Arithmatic accuracy and logical reasoning
   - **Response**:

   ```
    To get a total of 12 apples and 9 oranges, you can calculate the number of packs needed for each fruit separately.

    For apples: Since each pack contains 4 apples, you would need 12/4 = 3 packs of apples.

    For oranges: Since each pack contains 3 oranges, you would need 9/3 = 3 packs of oranges.

    Therefore, you would need to buy 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges.
   ```

   - **Evaluation**: Simple and accurate
   - **Improvement**: Enhance math explanation using step-by-step format.

5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone‚Ä¶

   - **Aspect Tested**: Tone control, summarization, ability to maintain factual accuracy
   - **Input**:

   ```
    Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone:
    The current average tariff rate would still result in the highest tariffs in 90 years, noted Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo, in a Monday note to investors. That would lead to slower economic growth, higher inflation and higher interest rates for longer, according to Slok ‚Äî all major obstacles to the S&P 500 climbing higher.

    Geopolitics and second quarter earnings releases beginning in mid-July are other catalysts that could impact investor sentiment and the market, said Eric Freedman, CIO at US Bank Asset Management, said in a Monday note.

    ‚ÄúHow companies are absorbing or passing on tariff price increases represents a key item of investor interest in upcoming quarterly releases, with investors gauging the future impact on inflation, interest rates and economic growth,‚Äù Freedman said.

    Kumar at Jefferies said in a Wednesday note that he is looking for how US jobs data holds up this summer and whether Treasury yields rise due to concerns about the deficit, which could pull investors away from stocks.
   ```

   - **Response**:

   ```
    Torsten Slok, Chief Economist at Apollo, highlighted that the current average tariff rate would lead to the highest tariffs in 90 years, potentially causing slower economic growth, increased inflation, and prolonged high interest rates. These factors could pose significant challenges to the S&P 500's upward trajectory. Additionally, Eric Freedman, CIO at US Bank Asset Management, emphasized that geopolitical developments and second-quarter earnings releases starting in mid-July could influence investor sentiment and market dynamics. Freedman also underscored the importance of monitoring how companies manage tariff-related price increases in upcoming financial reports, as this will impact inflation, interest rates, and economic performance. Furthermore, Kumar at Jefferies noted a focus on the resilience of US jobs data during the summer and the potential for rising Treasury yields driven by deficit concerns, which may divert investor attention from stocks.

## üèóÔ∏èActivities (after optimization)

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.

   - **Aspect Tested**: Instruction following, explanation clarity, audience awareness
   - **Response**:

   ```
    Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of writing computer programs by organizing code into "objects" that represent real-world things. These objects have properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that define how they interact with each other.

    For example, you can think of a car as an object in OOP. The car object would have properties like color, model, and speed, and behaviors like drive, stop, and honk.

    By using OOP, developers can create reusable code, organize complex systems more effectively, and better represent real-world concepts in their programs.

4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?

   - **Aspect Tested**: Arithmetic accuracy and logical reasoning
   - **Response**:

   ```
    Let's denote the number of packs of apples as (a) and the number of packs of oranges as (o).

    Given that each pack of apples contains 4 apples, the total number of apples obtained from (a) packs is (4a).
    Similarly, each pack of oranges contains 3 oranges, so the total number of oranges obtained from (o) packs is (3o).

    We are given that we need exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges. Therefore, we can write two equations based on the information above:

    1. (4a = 12)  (for apples)
    2. (3o = 9)  (for oranges)

    Now, let's solve these equations one by one:

    1. From the first equation, we find (a = 12/4 = 3). So, you need to buy 3 packs of apples.

    2. From the second equation, we find (o = 9/3 = 3). So, you need to buy 3 packs of oranges.

    Therefore, you need to buy 3 packs of apples and 3 packs of oranges to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges.

   ```
