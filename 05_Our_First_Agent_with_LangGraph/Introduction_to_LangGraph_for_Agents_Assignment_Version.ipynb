        "### Why Cycles?\n",

        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-05\\nTitle: Resource-Efficient & Effective Code Summarization\\nAuthors: Saima Afrin, Joseph Call, Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Oscar Chaparro, Antonio Mastropaolo\\nSummary: Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated high effectiveness in\\nautomating software engineering tasks such as bug fixing, code generation, and\\ncode documentation.

The main goal of RAG is to produce more accurate, relevant, and up-to-date responses by grounding the model's output in external knowledge, rather than relying solely on the information contained within the model's training data.

It works by adding lightweight, low-rank matrices to the original model, which contain new weights. During fine-tuning, only these matrices are trained, not the entire model. This approach reduces computational requirements and training time, making it easier and faster to customize large models for particular applications. LoRA is especially useful for fine-tuning large language models and has been shown to enable quick and resource-efficient adaptation.

His research focuses on making foundation models like ChatGPT more accessible by reducing their resource requirements. He has developed algorithms and systems for memory-efficient, fast, and affordable deep learning. He is also the creator of the bitsandbytes library, which is widely used for efficient deep learning.

Inspired by human cognition, attention helps models process sequences more effectively, such as words in a sentence or regions in an image. It has revolutionized many areas of AI, including natural language processing and computer vision, by enabling models to decompose complex tasks into focused reasoning steps. Attention mechanisms improve both the performance and interpretability of AI systems.
